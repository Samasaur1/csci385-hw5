# building the project

The process for building the project is the same as projects 3 and 4, but it's no longer the most cursed thing about my submission!

# status of project

Before I attempted to interpolate normals, everything seemed to work (though of course the mirror was visibly paneled). Once I tried to interpolate normals, however, every other panel of the mirror became black. Nobody I've talked to has any idea why this is the case, so I'm submitting it anyway.

Note also that my code appears to be fairly inefficient. Specifically, don't try to resize spheres, or you will feel the lag.

I've now replaced my implementation with one that combines the subdivision and raytracing/interpolation steps.
